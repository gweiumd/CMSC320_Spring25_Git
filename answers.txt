Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: To maintain version control over a codebase, allowing branching, merging, backups, and collaboration.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be used in the climatology field. Retrieving insights from the data, training models, and other tasks
in this field use data science principles and techniques. 

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

a cleaner history, but can be more dangerous.
